# In order to keep load down, only record a sample of Slow Transactions.  In
# order to make that sampling as fair as possible, follow a basic algorithm:
#
# When adding a new SlowTransaction:
#  * Just add it if there is an open spot
#  * If there isn't an open spot, attempt to remove an over-represented
#    endpoint instead ("attempt_to_evict"). Overrepresented is simply "has more
#    than @fair number of SlowTransactions for that end point"
#  * If there isn't an open spot, and nobody is valid to evict, drop the
#    incoming SlowTransaction without adding.
#
# There is no way to remove SlowTransactions from this set, create a new object
# for each reporting period.
